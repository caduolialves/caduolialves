# About me
Hello there! My name is Carlos Eduardo Oliveira Alves, and I’m passionate about technology and software development.

I’m currently pursuing a degree in Analysis and Systems Development and have been diving deep into the world of technology for the past 3 and a half years. Throughout this journey, I’ve been learning, building, and experimenting with various tools, languages, and frameworks, always aiming to improve my skills and contribute to meaningful projects.
